## What Users Say About the Fostex MR-8 MkII
 
The Fostex MR-8 MkII has received mostly positive feedback from users who appreciate its ease of use, portability, and sound quality. Many users have praised its intuitive interface, which does not require much menu diving or complicated operations. Users also like the fact that it can record and playback eight tracks of uncompressed audio, unlike some other card-based recorders that use data compression or lower sampling rates.
 
However, some users have also pointed out some drawbacks and limitations of the Fostex MR-8 MkII. One common complaint is the lack of EQ and effects loop, which makes it difficult to shape the sound or add external effects. Users also wish it had more than two simultaneous recording inputs and more virtual tracks for overdubbing. Some users have reported problems with transferring audio files to and from a computer, especially on Mac systems, which require a card reader. Users also note that the recording time is limited by the card capacity, which can run out quickly at full resolution.
 
## How to Compare the Fostex MR-8 MkII with Other Card-Based Recorders
 
The Fostex MR-8 MkII is not the only card-based recorder on the market. There are several other models that offer different features and capabilities. Here are some factors to consider when comparing the Fostex MR-8 MkII with other card-based recorders:

- Number of tracks: The Fostex MR-8 MkII is the only card-based recorder that offers eight tracks of recording and playback. Other models, such as the Zoom MRS4B, Tascam DP004, Boss BR600, and Korg D4, offer four tracks of recording and playback.
- Recording resolution: The Fostex MR-8 MkII can record and playback audio at 16-bit/44.1 kHz (normal mode) or 16-bit/22.05 kHz (extended mode). Other models use data compression or lower sampling rates to extend the recording time. For example, the Zoom MRS4B uses MPEG1 Layer 2 compression at 64 kbps (mono) or 128 kbps (stereo), the Tascam DP004 uses 16-bit/32 kHz linear PCM, the Boss BR600 uses Roland's proprietary BR-format compression at 64 kbps (mono) or 128 kbps (stereo), and the Korg D4 uses 16-bit/31.25 kHz linear PCM.
- Simultaneous recording inputs: The Fostex MR-8 MkII has two simultaneous recording inputs with phantom power. Other models have either two or four simultaneous recording inputs, but not all of them have phantom power. For example, the Zoom MRS4B has four inputs (two XLR with phantom power and two 1/4-inch), the Tascam DP004 has two inputs (one XLR with phantom power and one 1/4-inch), the Boss BR600 has two inputs (one XLR with phantom power and one 1/4-inch), and the Korg D4 has four inputs (two XLR without phantom power and two 1/4-inch).
- Virtual tracks: The Fostex MR-8 MkII does not have any virtual tracks for overdubbing. Other models have varying numbers of virtual tracks for each physical track. For example, the Zoom MRS4B has eight virtual tracks per physical track (32 in total), the Tascam DP004 has four virtual tracks per physical track (16 in total), the Boss BR600 has eight virtual tracks per physical track (64 in total), and the Korg D4 has four virtual tracks per physical track (16 in total).
- Effects: The Fostex MR-8 MkII has built-in digital effects, including reverb, delay, guitar amp and mic simulators, and mastering effects. However, it does not have any EQ or effects loop. Other models have different types of effects, some more comprehensive than others. For example, the Zoom MRS4B has built-in digital effects, including EQ, reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, compression, limiter, exciter, pitch shifter, harmonizer, vocoder, wah-wah, tremolo, auto-panning, ring modulator, filter sweep, noise gate, lo 0f148eb4a0
